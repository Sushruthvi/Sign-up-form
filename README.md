# Project 3: Building Webpages Without any AI

A **frontend sign-up form**, inspired by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) project ideas.

What I learned:

How to create forms with HTML and style them with CSS

Implementing form validation and using labels effectively

Solving multiple flexbox layout challenges to make the form clean
